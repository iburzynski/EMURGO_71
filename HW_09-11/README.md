# Batch 71: Homework for September 10 & 11
**Note:** homework assignments are not graded, but it is strongly encouraged to complete them in order to build understanding between sessions and keep up with the pace of the course. It is recommended to spend ~30 min. per day engaging with the homework material.

## Readings: Textbook
If you haven't completed the following lessons, please do so before next session:
* *Get Programming with Haskell*: **Lessons 30 - 32** (p. 372 - 411)

**OPTIONAL:** You can complete the Capstone project in Lesson 33 ("SQL-like queries in Haskell", p. 411 - 428) for additional practice with monads.

## Readings: Tutorials
The following tutorials will be covered over the next two sessions. It is recommended to read them in advance if possible, so you can better follow along with the code examples in class:
* *William Yao: Deriving the State Monad from First Principles*: https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2020-07-12-deriving-state-monad.html
* *William Yao: Deriving the Reader Monad from First Principles*:

**OPTIONAL:** In the interest of time and because it isn't typically used in practice due to performance problems, we won't be covering the Writer monad. You are welcome to review this tutorial on your own if you are interested.
